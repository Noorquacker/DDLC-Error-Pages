# DDLC-Error-Pages
Error pages for your website - now for weeaboos!

This thing is a bunch of basic PHP and HTML and CSS stuff I made a [while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/9jyogm/ddlc_website_error_pages/) when I was bored. I decided to put it on Github after 2 years of doing nothing and then realizing I don't have 504.

Mine are on [my website](https://www.nqind.com/err/404.php) if you want a preview. Mine do have extra Yotsuba images, but that's not a pure DDLC theme

I do recommend changing each file to use absolute links and put in its own folder of error pages if you're on nginx with multiple domains and want to just symlink the other domains to an original folder.

Have fun.
